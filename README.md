# TeenHacks-2018
Our hack for the 2018 TeenHacks Hackathon, our team's first hackathon! Developed by Govind Pimpale, Ganesh Pimpale, Marek Pinto, and Kyle Pu. 09/08/2018.

# Wheelchair Way
Our hack aims to improve accessibility for people with disabilities (especially those bound to wheelchairs). This app implements the Google Maps API to determine elevation, latitude, and longitude data in order to determine the most convenient path to take (for those with disabilities).

Goals: To generate routes on maps that take more topography features into account.

Bugs:
[ ] Our main bug was not found within the time of the hackathon. Unfortunately, when attempting to bring together the JavaScript and the UI, the path was not being displayed. When run separately, however, the pathfinding algorithm appeared to work fine.
